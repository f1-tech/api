# PurpleSector

This is a Fomula API build in Rust and currently under development. The goal is to provide a simple and easy to use API to access the ergast database and in the end, provide a new maintained database after the 2024 season.

## Project Roadmap

- [x] Create all the basic API endpoints to access the ergast DB
- [ ] Add a configuration file to the API
- [ ] Create a complete swagger documentation
- [ ] Create an automated tool to update the DB in prevision of the ergast deprecated DB for next season
- [ ] Create a new DB for the F2 championship (maybe even F3 and F1 academy as well as WEC or other championships)
- [ ] Add a predictor to the API (an LLM model that will try to predict upcoming races results)
- [ ] Create a landing page for the API
- [ ] Create a simple front-end to access the API
